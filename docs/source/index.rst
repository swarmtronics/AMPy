Welcome to AMPy documentation!
===================================

**AMPy** is a *baseline* library built upon [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to easily process experimental video data for active matter and disordered systems.

It consists of methods allowing to extract kinematics from video data and evaluate various charactersitics relevant for active matter studies. Check out the :doc:`Tutorial` section for usage examples and :doc:`Package Reference` for complete description of available methods.
