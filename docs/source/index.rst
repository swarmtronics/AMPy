Welcome to AMPy documentation!
===================================

**AMPy** is a *baseline* library built upon [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to easily process experimental video data for active matter and disordered systems. The library turns the processing of video recordings of experiments from hard work into a cakewalk and greatly speeds up the process of writing code in order to extract useful characteristics from.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
