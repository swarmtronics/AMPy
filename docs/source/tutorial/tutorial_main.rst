Introduction by Example
=======================

We shortly introduce usage basics of AMPy through several self-contained examples. Along with this textual tutorial, you can try to run this code on `Colab Notebook <(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hiCGXoDtOEO3LOm6RG12111Kiwofh069?usp=sharing>`_ or watch corresponding video:

Essentially, AMPy allows you to perform the following processing procedures:

Extract Kinematics from Raw Video
-----------------------

We will show a simple example of extracting trajectories from the predefined video:

  :align: center
  :width: 300px

First, we need to ...

.. code-block:: python

    import ampy

.. Note::
	If you are lucky to have your own tracking software, you can still use AMPy to evaluate various statistical characteristics. In 	order to do that, it is required converting your data to the following format:

	- :obj:``: 
	- :obj:``: 
	- etc.
